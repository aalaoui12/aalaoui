## About Me

![headshot](/assets/images/headshot.jpeg){:class="img-responsive"}

Iâ€™m Ali, a student at UPenn graduating with a CS degree in December 2023. I was born and raised in the Bay Area, and now live in Morocco.

I'm fascinated by all things web3, energy, and startups. As I go into "the real world", I made this website to document my thoughts on some of these areas, with a particular focus on how web3 can reach a billion people.
