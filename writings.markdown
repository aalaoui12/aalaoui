I became curious about blockchains and web3 in early 2022, around the time when NFT projects were all anyone talked about. 

After seeing the hype around NFT projects, I started to wonder: what is the value proposition of web3, its core components that will be essential to society in 5-10 years? And what aspects are trends that won't last?

This led me down a rabbithole of learning. Most recently, I worked for Alchemy, where I explored blockchain scaling solutions and user experiences.

As I continue to think about what the future of web3 will look like, I have documented some of my thoughts here.
